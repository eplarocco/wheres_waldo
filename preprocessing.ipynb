    "- Double-checked that the images we were given were correctly bounded (did this by visualizing the boxes on the images - they look good!)\n",
    "- Complication: Originally when I creating augmented images, the bounding box labels did not also augment. I also had to try out a few types of augmentation to see what made sense for waldo. The augmented images may still not be as different from one another as they could be which could allow the model to favor the training images that occur more frequently.\n",
    "- Complication: Similarly, when resizing the images, ensuring the bounding boxes not only are also adjusted if necessary, but ensuring they do not get cut off and the image is not stretched/shrunk too much.\n",
    "- Tried Yolo architecture first but produced too many boxes and did not work well. Tried faster rcnn architecture next and the inputs and outputs and processing steps for each were very different which was frustrating"
